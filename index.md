# JackGames Portfolio:

## Welcome/Introduction:

Hey there! My Name is Jack, and I'm a YouTuber, Discord Bot Developer, and Moderator/Admin for a number of large Discord communities! This is my "Portfolio" of sorts, where I'll discuss my experience and more! If you want to reach out to me, you can contact me via Discord, by joining my server [here](https://discord.gg/2thPqQWJsR) and making a ticket via the ðŸŽŸmake-a-ticketðŸŽŸ channel!

**Now to talk about some of my experience in different fields!**

## Discord/Server Moderation:

_One of the main things I like doing in Moderation for online communnities. Here are some examples of where I've been a moderator:_

### HoaxMC:

This is a Minecraft Server. It is owned by three large YouTubers, who go by the names Jelly, Slogo, and MrCrainer. With a combined total of over 20 million subscribers, this is their official Minecraft Server. I joined the HoaxMC Staff Team as a Trial Moderator back in June 2020, and worked my way through the staff ranks (Trial Mod, Moderator, Mod+) before getting promoted to a Senior Moderator in September 2020. I then remained as a Senior Moderator until May 2021, retiring after around 11 months on the team. You can check out the HoaxMC Discord Server [here](https://hoaxmc.com/discord)

### Wardy's Discord Server:

This is the biggest server I currently hold a position on. I am one of the three administrator's for Wardy's Discord Server, which currently has over 22,000 members. I am also the developer of Wardy's custom Discord bot (more details about that later). You can check out his server [here](https://discord.gg/Zn7T36EKK5)
